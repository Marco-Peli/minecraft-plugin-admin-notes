This repo contains sources for minecraft plugin (SpigotMC) "Admin Notes"

Imagine the scene...

A player joins your server, he had a bad day today and your day was stressful as well, he say something the you might not like butâ€¦Hey hey hey! Put down that banhammer!

Now there is AdminNotes to help you taking decisions and give a second chance to people that might deserve it.

With AdminNotes your staff will be able to share notes on players, so that you will take actions, warning and bans based on previous behaviours.
